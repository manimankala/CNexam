iv. Simulate to Find the Number of Packets Dropped due to Congestion
AIM:
Simulate the transmission of ping messages over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes
and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion. Topology:-
Sender:-
stcp –p 2000 –l 1024 1.0.1.4
Receiver:-
rtcp –p 2000 –l 1024
Command Console:-
Goto tools-> simulation time and change Simulation time to 100. During run mode, double
click host 2 and then click command console. And execute the following command. ping 1.0.1.4
Parameters:-
Drop Packets and Collision Packets.
      
Step1: Drawing topology
1. Select/click the SUBNET icon on the toolbar and click the left mouse button on the editor, to
place a SUBNET on the editor.
2. A pop up window appears requesting the number of nodes and radius for the subnet Set number of nodes=6;
Set radius of subnet >150
3. Click on the “E” icon on the toolbar to save the current topology e.g: file4.tpl (Look for the ******.tpl extension.)
NOTE: Changes cannot / (should not) be done after selecting
Step2: Configuration
1. Double click the left mouse button while cursor is on a HOST to open the HOST window.
2. Click NODE EDITOR Button on the HOST window and select the INTERFACE tab (1st tab) from the
modal window that pops up.
3. Determine the IP address of the selected host.
4. Click OK button on the INTERFACE window to exit and once again click on the OK button on the HOST window to exit.
5. Repeat the above step for 2 other HOSTS
6. Also click NODE EDITOR Button on the HOST window and select the MAC tab from the modal window that pops up.
7. Select LOG STATISTICS and select checkbox for drop and collision log statistics in the MAC window
  
8. Click OK button on the MAC window to exit and once again click on the OK button on the HOST window to exit.
9. Repeat steps 6 to 9 for the other hosts selected at step 5.
10. Select G_Setting from the menu bar and select Simulation from the drop down list Set simulation time>600sec
Step3: Simulate
i. Click “R” icon on the tool bar
ii. Select Simulation in the menu bar and click/ select RUN in the dropdown list to execute the simulation.
iii. During simulation, open a new terminal window.
iv. Type ping IP address of a host in the subnet at the command prompt.
v. To view results, Open up new TERMINAL window, move to file4.results folder and open drop
and collision log files in separate TERMINAL window.
