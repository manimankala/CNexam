AIM:
Simulate a four-node point-to-point network and connect the link as follows: Apply a TCP agent
between n0 to n3 and apply a UDP agent between n1 and n3. Apply relevant applications over
TCP and UDP agents changing the parameters and determine the number of packets sent by two
agents.
Topology:-
Sender:-
stcp –p 3000 –l 1024 1.0.1.3
stg –u 1024 1.0.1.3
Receiver:-
rtcp –p 3000 –l 1024
rtg –u 3000
Parameters:-
Throughput of incoming and outgoing Packets
Step1: Drawing topology
1. Select/click the HOST icon on the toolbar and click the left mouse button on the editor, to
place a host on the editor. Repeat the above procedure and place two other hosts “HOST2” and 
“HOST3” on the editor.
2. Select/click the HUB (or SWITCH) icon on the toolbar and click the left mouse button on the
editor, to place a HUB (or SWITCH) on the editor.
3. Click on the LINK icon on the toolbar and connect HOST1 to HUB, HOST2 to HUB and HUB
to HOST3
4. Click on the “E” icon on the toolbar to save the current topology e.g: file2.tpl (Look for the
******.tpl extension.)
NOTE: Changes cannot / (should not) be done after selecting the “E” icon.
Step2: Configuration
1. Double click the left mouse button while cursor is on HOST1 to open the HOST window.
2. Select Add button on the HOST window to invoke the command window and provide the
following command in the command textbox.
stcp –p 21 –l 1024 1.0.1.3
3. Click OK button on the command window to exit
4. Click NODE EDITOR Button on the HOST window and select the MAC tab from the modal
window that pops up.
5. Select LOG STATISTICS and select checkbox for output throughput in the MAC window
6. Click OK button on the MAC window to exit and once again click on the OK button on the
HOST window to exit.
7. Double click the left mouse button while cursor is on HOST2 to open the HOST window.
8. Select Add button on the HOST window to invoke the command window and provide the 
following command in the command textbox.
stg –u 1024 100 1.0.1.3
9. Click OK button on the command window to exit
10. Click NODE EDITOR Button on the HOST window and select the MAC tab from the modal
window that pops up.
11. Select LOG STATISTICS and select checkbox for output throughput in the MAC window
12. Click OK button on the MAC window to exit and once again click on the OK button on the
HOST window to exit
13. Double click the left mouse button while cursor is on HOST3 to open the HOST window.
14. Select Add button on the HOST window to invoke the command window and provide the
following command in the command textbox.
rtcp –p 21 –l 1024
15. Click OK button on the command window to exit.
16. Also add the following command on HOST3
 rtg –u –w log1
17. Click NODE EDITOR Button on the HOST window and select the MAC tab from the modal
window that pops up.
18. Select LOG STATISTICS and select checkbox for input and output throughput in the MAC
window 
19. Click OK button on the MAC window to exit and once again click on the OK button on the
HOST window to exit.
Step3: Simulate
i. Click “R” icon on the tool bar
ii. Select Simulation in the menu bar and click/ select RUN in the dropdown list to execute the
 simulation.
iii. To start playback select “►” icon located at the bottom right corner of the editor.
iv. To view results, Open up new TERMINAL window, move to file2.results folder and open
input and output throughput log files in separate TERMINAL window.
Caution: file2 is the hypothetical name given to this simulation.
